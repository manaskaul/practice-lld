Functional Requirements:

System should start a new game with an empty 3x3 board (9 squares)
System should allow two player game
System should allow players to play turn-by-turn
System should assign the players with two symbols - O or X
System should allow players to make a move only on their turn
A valid move should be allowed only on an empty cell
After each move system should check if the player has won
System should detect win if the player has 3 symbols (o's or X's) in a row - horizontally/vertically/diagonally
System should detect draw, if there are no empty square left to be played and no player has won
Once the game ends, system should reject further moves unless to start a new game

Non Functional Requirements:

System should always correctly identify player win or draw
System should be extensible to make the game board NxN
System should be extensible to allow Player vs Computer
