Elevator system is essentially 3 basic types of decisions:

Request Decision
    What does the button press mean?
        - Hall Call Request (Floor + Direction)
        - Elevator Floor Request (Floor)

Scheduling Decision
    Which elevator should handle the incoming request?
        - Elevator Direction
        - Current Floor
        - Load
        - Stratergy (Nearest, Scan, OddEven, etc)

Movement Decision
    How does the elevator move once assigned?
        - Door Open/Close
        - Move Up/Down
        - Stop Logic
        - State Transions

Func Requirements:
    The system should allow users on a floor to request an elevator using UP or DOWN buttons.
    The system should dispatch an elevator to pick up users requesting service on a floor.
    Once inside an elevator, users should be able to select a destination floor.
    The elevator should transport users to their selected destination floor.
    The system should support multiple elevators operating concurrently.
    The system should ensure elevators stop at requested floors to pick up or drop off users.
    The system should continue operating correctly as requests arrive concurrently.

Non Func Requirements:
    An elevator must not skip a requested stop once it has accepted it.
    Direction and movement state must remain consistent.
    The system should respond promptly to hall and car button presses.
    Assignment of an elevator to a hall request should happen within a bounded time.
    No floor or request should be starved indefinitely.
    Repeated requests from one area should not permanently block others.
    The system should support increasing number of elevators and floors without redesign.
    Scheduling logic should not degrade sharply as elevators increase.
    New scheduling strategies should be pluggable without modifying elevator movement logic.

Events :
    User presses the call button
        What to do with this request?
        Which elevator to assign this request?
        Where in the queue would this request go?
    Elevator arrives at the floor
        Should the elevator stop
        Which direction should the elevator move next
    User selects the floor after getting on the elevator
        How to handle this request?
        Where in the queue would this request go?
