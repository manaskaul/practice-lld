First pressure appears: 
The pricing logic can change over time, grow complex based on the vehicle type, day of the week, etc

Solution:
Introduce PricingStratergy
Use Stratergy Pattern to implement different types of stratergies
    FlatPricingStratergy
    DynamicPricingStratergy
    SurgePricingStratergy


Second pressure appears:
The spot allocation can grow over time and become complex to handle multiple types of vehicles, shortest to exit, etc

Solution
The same concept can be used in spot allocation as well
Introduce SpotAllocationStratergy
Use stratergy pattern to implement the different types of stratergies
    LowerFLoorFirstStratergy
    VehicleTypeStratergy
    NearestToExitStratergy
    PriorityParkingStratergy

for both these cases the decision of fee pricing and spot allocations stays with ParkingLot
but the knowledge and computation is delegated to PricingStratergy and SpotAllocationStratergy
